Implemented a circular buffer with char device drvier
max buffer size of 20 bytes , overwrites the data when overflows the buffer
1. All the data provided by user (max 20 bytes) should be written to the buffer and anything over 20
bytes should be dropped
2. Internally, driver should maintain a write pointer which points to the location where new data can
be written. Newer data would overwrite the old data, if not read.
3. Driver should maintain a read pointer which points to data to be read next.
